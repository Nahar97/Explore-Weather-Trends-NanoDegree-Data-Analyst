# Explore-Weather-Trends-NanoDegree-Data-Analyst
Project-1 Explore weather Trends

The project was accomplished as part of the criteria of a course in Udacity. This is the Explore Weather Trends project of Udacity's Nanodegree program. The aim is to establish visualization, and to iidentify the similarities and differences between global temperature patterns and local city temperature trends.

Steps:

  1. extracting data from database.
  2. Building a line diagram for the data.
  3. Makeing observations with the local average temperature on the similarities and variations between the world average temeprature.

The report was generated in the form of a PDF document.

Tools Used:

  1. Python
  3. Jupyter Notebook

Submission

1. How to evaluate the Moving Averages?
2. How to visualize the trends between local and global average temperatures?
3. Ploting the chart with local and global temperature trends
4. Write up atleast four observations about the similarities and differences in the trends.
